# Android-Apps
All apps are fully functional unless otherwise stated. All apps were developed for personal learning purposes, 
but are certainly open to changes! :]

**Apps included:**
==================
**Fun Facts**: A very simple app that contains a bunch of facts and colors that are randomly displayed when the user clicks a button.

**Interactive Story**: A story-based app that presents the user with a picture and some dialog that progresses based on the user's choice.

**Weather**: A detailed weather app that gives the current, daily, and weekly weather forecasts. The weather data is retrieved from the Forecast.io API and is presented in list views and a recycler view. The app also responds to the user's current location using the Google Maps API, but if not, a hard-coded location is used instead. 

**Snapshat**: A mock Snapchat app that allows users to take timed photos to send to other users if they are friends. Users have the option to take a photo with their phone's camera or choose one from their camera roll. Once a user clicks on a photo/video from another user, the photo/video is displayed for 10 seconds until it self deletes. The photos/videos, user relationships and account information are all stored on Parse.com to be used in the app. Users have to sign up and/or log in with the app in order to use it. For Android only, push notifications are also sent when a user recieves a message (photo/video) from another user
